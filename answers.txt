Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is widely considered and used due to its clean version control capabilities by creating a detailed history of your changes that allow you to view prior commits or track/revert previous work. This ability to track provides seamless collaboration and communcation amongst multiple parties and allows individuals to work on a project at the same time without overwriting someone's work.
